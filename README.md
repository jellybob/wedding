= Wedding Site

This is the wedding site which I built when getting married. You can
see what it looked like at http://wedding.blankpad.net/ if you like.

I've made it public in case people want to use it for something, and
as a general example of a simple Django site.

== Installation

If you are setting this up, you'll need to change the paths in settings.py,
and then treat it like a Django application. I'm probably not the best person
to ask for help, since it's the only Django thing I have ever deployed, but
if you like, give me a shout.
