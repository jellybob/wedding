	<h2>The Ceremony</h2>
	<p>The wedding ceremony will take place at St. James Church, Southampton at 11am</p>
	
	<h2>The Reception</h2>
	<p>After the ceremony we'll be having a reception at the New Forest Lodge in Lyndhurst.</p>
	<p>This is split into two parts - at 1pm there will be a site down meal for our family and
	   the wedding party. Sadly we can't invite everyone to this, but at 2:30pm there will be a
	   buffet meal, music, dancing, and general festivities.</p>
